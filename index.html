            You are one of many. You are a Dark Matter Creature, a Damacreat. One of the lowest life forms existing in
            the vast space of Dark Matter. You have just evolved your first pair of thrusters. Once you learn how to
            navigate, you will have a better chance at surviving in the hostile environment that is Dark Matter.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's eat or be eaten. Survive! Grow! Dominate!
        </p>
        <p>
            Or so it should be. Luckily for you, God only had two days to create the Damacreats. And you are the first
            and only prototype with a digestive system. So it just eat! Eat! EAT!
