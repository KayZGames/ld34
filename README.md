---------

You are one of many. You are a Dark Matter Creature, a Damacreat. One of the lowest life forms existing in the vast space
of Dark Matter. You have just evolved your first pair of thrusters. Once you learn how to navigate, you will have a
better chance at surviving in the hostile environment that is Dark Matter.

It's eat or be eaten. Survive! Grow! Dominate!
