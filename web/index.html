        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
            You are one of many. You are a Dark Matter Creature, a Damacreat. One of the lowest life forms existing in
            the vast space of Dark Matter. You have just evolved your first pair of Dark Energy dischargers. Once you
            learn how to navigate, you will have a better chance at surviving in the hostile environment that is Dark
            Matter.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's eat or be eaten. Survive! Grow! Dominate!
        </p>
        <p>
            Or so it should be. Luckily for you, God only had two days to create the Damacreats. And you are the first
            and only prototype with a digestive system. So it's just eat! Eat! EAT!

                    <td>Move forward</td>
                    <td>F + J</td>
                    <td>Left + Right mouse button</td>
                </tr>
                </tbody>

            <p>
                If the controls are too hard for you, turn your mouse or keyboard by 180Â°. And remember, you are in
                space, once you are in motion, you will stay in motion. Dark Matter doesn't cause any friction.
                It's a proven fact.
